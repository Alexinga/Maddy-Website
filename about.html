                <p>Hello, my name is Madeline. I am a yoga teacher, language teacher, and artist. I offer online and in person yoga and language classes.</p>
                <p>I create and teach yoga classes based on my training in the Hatha and Vinyasa Flow styles. My classes are grounded in the breath; it's through this relationship that we cultivate graceful strength and flexibility, and promote energy balance. Together, we move through sequences designed to open and warm the body, move and balance energy, build strength, quiet the mind, and drop into the heart. My classes are not fast-paced or intense, but rather calming, breath-focused, and strong.</p>
                <p>I teach most fluently to students who have some prior experience practicing yoga; however, I am more than happy to teach a beginner class if requested.</p>
                <p>If you are someone looking at yoga to get grounded and calm amidst an oftentimes busy and frenetic world, someone desiring to relax, drop in, and establish a healthier relationship with yourself and othersâ€”then I believe these classes would be of benefit to you.</p>
                <p>I have been a yoga practitioner since my teens and am now a 200 hour Yoga Alliance Registered Teacher (RYT) as a result of my studies with Yoga Farm Ithaca. Yoga Farm's certification programs are trauma-informed, incredibly comprehensive, and steeped in inclusive language.</p>
                <p>I also offer online English and Spanish language classes, as much of my professional experience lies in studying and teaching languages. In the English realm, I guide adults with intermediate-advanced fluency to refine their skills. In the Spanish realm, I offer beginner-intermediate practice sessions for children, adolescents, and adults. All of the language classes I offer are intuitive and less formal than one would typically find in the teaching/tutoring sphere.</p>
                <p>Get to know me and stay updated on my yoga offerings by following @madeline_mrugal on Instagram. For more information on the services I offer or if you want to schedule a time to chat, email me at madelinemrugal@gmail.com.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting me here & I can't wait to work with you!</p>
